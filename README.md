Plugin for MTG Card Tooltips
============================

Enables card images to show on mouseover for Magic the Gathering cards.

Description
-----------

[deckbox.org](http://deckbox.org) provides a javascript utility that enables links to its 
Magic the Gathering card pages to automatically show card image tooltips on hover. 
For more information see [the tooltips integration page](http://deckbox.org/help/tooltips).

This **VBulletin** plugin provides the bbcode tag `[cards]` that turns a simple card list
into links to card pages. It automatically includes the tooltip.js file that provides the
mouseover functionality.


Usage
-----

After installing the plugin xml, use the `[cards]` bbcode to surround MtG card names or deck 
lists in your posts.


Examples
--------

in a `[cards]` tag.
